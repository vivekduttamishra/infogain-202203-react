                            The story of the epic battle of Kurukshetra has been told and retold for ages.
                            Millennia of dust, fables, imaginations â€” and the epic itself is lost.
                            What remained is the story of a family feud and ambition of Kauravas and Pandavas.
                            But why, then, was this an epic war? Why entire Aryavart plunged into this first
                            real world-war? Why the echo of this ancient war still resonates after all those
                            centuries?
